  WORKING BRANCHES

  As of April 18, 2020:
  Reverted to Master from branch ID_minDR_matchstore.
  - The branch has some features and bug fixes that should be pushed to master but the overall structure of information storage is messy.
  - Features include storing the matched PAT photon and their indices.
  - Bug fixes include making sure that the "matched gen and pat indices" are not out of range. Like -999999 will cause a runtime error.

  Branching out to NewSinglePhotonAnalyzer
  - This is to create a new analyzer with a tree information structure suitable and made specifically for efficiency studies
  - This is also to double check if we got the "storing" and the efficiency correctly.

  As of March 2, 2020:
  master    : Pythia8 local GEN only analyzer (working)
  - Added feature on deltaR matching information between gen and pat photons

  CMSSW_80X : -Include globalTags
              -other elements from ExoDiPhotonAnalyzer (under development)
